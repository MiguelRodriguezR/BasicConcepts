 A quick port of the Reveal.js framework into codepen so that I can house my presentations for the classes I teach.

I'm combining the essentials of Hakim El Hattab's excellent Reveal.js presentation framework. (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) with Jack Doyle's GSAP "greensock" animation platform (http://www.greensock.com/) to see if I can rival Keynote's slidey goodness.
